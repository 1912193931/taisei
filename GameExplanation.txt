Taisei Project

Game Explanation:

* Avoid being shot by the bullets

* There are 3 buttons:
    * Shoot - Z     - shoots your weapon depending on your current weapon power
    * Bomb  - X     - kills everything on the screen for some time
    * Focus - Shift - described further down

* Labels on the right are:
    * Player = how many lifes you have (only full stars count as a life)
    * Bombs  = how many bombs you have
    * Power  = How powerful your weapon currently is

* Killed enemies drop various amouts of COLLECTABLES.
  These are:
    * blue (gives scores)
    * red (increases weapon power - see the 'power' stars on the right)
    * green star (gives a bomb fragment - 5 fragments are one bomb)
    * pink star (gives a life fragment - 5 fragments are one life)

* If you fly near to the top of the screen, all the visible collectables will be picked up (shown as flying towards you)

* While pressing SHIFT, your movement is slower and the weapon will be more focused, hence the name "Focus" to describe this mode.

Knowing this should help to get you started!

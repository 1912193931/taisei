Taisei

1. Introduction

Taisei is an open clone of the Touhou series. Touhou is a one-man project of
shoot-em-up games set in an isolated world full of Japanese folklore.

2. Installation

Dependencies:
	- SDL2, SDL2_ttf
	- libpng, ZLIB
	- OpenGL
	- OpenAL, ALUT
	- CMake (build system)

Optional:
	- libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile (to play .ogg BGMs)

To build and install Taisei just follow these steps.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$yourprefix ..
make
make install

This will install game data to $prefix/share/taisei/ and build this path
_statically_ into the executable. This might be a package maintainer's choice.
Alternatively you may want to add -DRELATIVE=TRUE to get a relative structure
like

$prefix/taisei
$prefix/data/
($prefix/config)

RELATIVE is always set when building for Windows.

3. NOTE ABOUT REPLAYS

As of version 1.0 replays are not guaranteed to work between different
operating systems or architectures (or compiler versions). Screen capture
your replays if you really want to publish them.

4. NOTE ABOUT BACKGROUND MUSIC

Currently Taisei does not include any background music. To use this feature,
you should have required audio files in bgm/ subdirectory.
BGM may either be in .wav format, or in .ogg; last one apply only if you have
compiled Taisei with libogg, libvorbis and libvorbisfile (automatically enabled
if cmake is able to find them).

Complete music pack consists of 16 bgm_*.ogg or bgm_*.wav files, where `*' mean:
	credits		BGM for credits screen
	ending		BGM for ending
	gameover	BGM for game over screen
	menu		BGM for menus (excluding in-game menu which pauses BGM)
	stageN		N=1..6, standard stage theme
	stageNboss	N=1..6, boss theme for a stage

If you want to specify stage/boss theme names to be shown during gameplay, you
may do it in bgm/bgm.conf file. This file contains some lines, each of which
consists of bgm filename (without extension), space of tab, and theme name.
No space/tab allowed either in beginning of line or BGM filenames listed in
this file; theme names may contain them.

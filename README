Seiyou

1. Introduction

Seiyou is an open clone of the Touhou series. Touhou is a one-man project of shoot-em-up games set in an isolated world full of Japanese folklore.

2. Installation

Dependencies:
	- SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf
	- OpenGL
	- CMake (build system)

To build and install Seiyou just follow these steps.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$yourprefix ..
make
make install

Note: Installing is necessary as otherwise the game data would not be found in the right place. If you want to test set the installation prefix to "." or $(pwd).

■ 1. Incident
================================================================================

  Another villain threatens to turn the land of dreams into a place of terror.
  The barrier is disrupted. Unknown forces reach for control over the borders
  themselves, throwing all of Gensōkyō into chaos.

■ 2. Characters
================================================================================


  ○ Kirisame Marisa

    Because it’s a fan game after all.

    One day, just as spring rolled around, Marisa went to check the shelves,
    only to notice that her cash box was as empty as the shop itself.
    It was an unusually quiet day, with hardly any customers around.

    And it was going to be a very boring day at this rate.

    As she languidly gazed around the shop, her eyes settled on a brand new
    issue of the Bunbunmaru Newspaper on the table. “At least that shows up
    every day,” she thought to herself. Anything to distract her now.

        “News Exclusive: Border Broken?!”

    The headline did not fail to grab her attention.

        “[…] large crowd of bewildered yōkai […]”

    “I am *so* going to check that out!”, she thought, her eyes lighting up
    in a flash of excitement and determination, happy to have found a better
    diversion than looking after her depressingly empty shop.

    “Time to spark some ass!”


  ○ Konpaku Yōmu

    Because Yōmu is awesome.

    A blossomless spring dawn in the Netherworld. Shattering noises cut through
    the gardens of passed souls. Noises even ghosts would find disconcerting.
    This ending night was as unusual as they come. The entire Netherworld was
    awake early, including Yuyuko-sama and of course a certain half-phantom
    girl.

    “I cannot sleep like this. Can the restless not have at least this kind of
    rest? Something really needs to be done about this, or I will go insane.”

    “Of course, Yuyuko-sama. I shall slash every little clangor in this world
    until your sleep is left undisturbed!”

    Hakugyokurō’s close connection with the border makes it sensitive to
    changes of the border’s structure. Yōmu, being aware of that, decided to
    investigate this “border breaking” rumor first.

■ 4. Bosses
================================================================================

  ○ Stage 1 Boss
    Cirno

    While clueless about the course of events, she still jumps into action with
    full force. Her reckless courage may seem like foolishness to others, but
    she is bound and determined to bend history in her favor.



  ○ Stage 2 Boss
    Kagiyama Hina

    Hina was the first considerably strong yōkai to show up at the place of
    action, which is why she ended up as the inofficial overseer of the growing
    crowd. Actually, the only thing she wanted was to maintain a modicum of law
    and order in her forest.



  ○ Stage 3 Boss
    Wriggle

    When bug-yōkai like Wriggle gain a reasonable amount of power, it is only
    natural for them to become a bit overconfident. Fortunately, that alone
    wasn’t enough for her to become the final boss.

    The story doesn’t take place underground after all.



  ○ Stage 4 Boss
    Kurumi

    She is a friend of Elly’s… or at least her former kōhai. Some time ago,
    Elly dragged her along when she left her mansion to set out on a longer
    journey, and now they have returned. Still trying her best at keeping all
    the curious yōkai (and players) who are entering from the tunnel off
    Elly’s back, she grew tired of being her bodyguard long ago.

    Somehow they’ve really taken a liking to each other.



  ○ Stage 5 Boss
    Nagae Iku

    She slipped through the guard right after the player. No one knows what
    she is after, but there are two things she hates:

    Being interrupted when she is in a hurry and always being under suspicion.

    Both happening at the same time has made her lose her temper.
    But that makes her seem even more suspicious, doesn't it?



  ○ Stage 6 Boss
    Elly

    She quit her task of guarding that mansion in Lotus Land Story for unknown
    reasons and obtained a new power and character from the outside world: the
    power to manipulate relations (i.e. she can do fancy maths). This enabled
    her to trick Gensōkyō’s border* and create herself a new place for research
    using her new powers.

    On that high tower, she wants to research The Theory of Everything.

    Maybe she didn’t even plan to use it to anyone’s harm. She certainly didn’t
    expect the location she chose for her tower to cause that much trouble.
    But that’s the very nature of scientists. Research comes first.

    Her spellcards are based on physical phenomena, turning her experiments
    into powerful weapons.

    Fun Fact™: Taisei actually uses complex math for projectile positioning.


    * It’s not like the border is an absolute barrier to yōkai. It is not
      uncommon for powerful yōkai to pass through there without much trouble.
      Some even visit the outside world regularly to hunt humans for food.
      But Elly broke it at some place and made it lead to her own place
      *somewhere inbetween*, which is unusual and shouldn’t be easily possible.

■ 1. Incident
================================================================================

  Yet another culprit terrorizes the land of dreams. This time, the functioning
  of the barrier is disrupted. Unknown powers reach for the control of the
  borders themselves and for the matter beyond them: Profit, blur and the
  relativity of limits.

  ○ Kirisame Marisa

    Because it's a fan game after all.

    In the first morning of spring, Marisa checked the shop's shelves as she
    noticed that her cash box was all empty. There was nobody around. Normally
    at least a few customers would drop by … but this state left Marisa really
    bored.
    She glanced around the shop, sighted … but there was a paper on her table.
    A brand new issue of the Bunbunmaru Newspaper. At least that one is never
    late.

    "News Exclusive: Border Broken?"

    The headline catched her eyes in an instant.

    "[…] large gathering of curious youkai […]"

    "Ok I'll better take a look!", she thought, happy about having found an
    exciting alternative to looking after her empty shop.

    "Time to spark som ass!"


  ○ Konpaku Youmu

    Because Youmu is awesome.

    A blossomless spring morning in the Netherworld … or rather before
    morning. Shattering noise cut the gardens of passed souls. A noise not even
    ghosts can enjoy.
    This ending night was in fact nothing like a normal night. The whole
    Netherworld was awake early, including Yuyuko-sama and of course the
    half-phantom girl.

    "I cannot sleep. I think the restless should at least get this kind of rest
    … this really has to be changed or I will get lunatic."

    "Of course, Yuyuko-sama. I will slash every little clangor in this world
    until your sleep is left undisturbed!"

    The fact that Hakugyokuro is closely connected to the border makes it
    sensitive to changes of the borders structure. Youmu knew that, so she
    decided to look after this "border breaking" rumor first.

■ 4. Bosses
================================================================================

  ○ Stage 1 Boss
    Cirno

    Of course she has no idea of the course of events, but she still steps into
    action full of power and courage to bend history to her favour.



  ○ Stage 2 Boss
    Kagiyama Hina

    She was somehow the first considerably strong youkai at the place of action,
    therefore she ended up as the inofficial overseer of the growing crowd. In
    fact, the only thing she wanted was to maintain a bit of law and order in
    her forest.



  ○ Stage 3 Boss
    Wriggle

    When a half-youkai like Wriggle gets reasonable amounts of power, it is only
    natural for them to get a bit self confident. Fortunately, it wasn't enough
    to get the final boss because of this.

    The story doesn't take place underground after all.



  ○ Stage 4 Boss
    Kurumi

    She is a friend of Elly's … or at least her former kouhai. Somehow she got
    dragged into a longer journey and returned now together with Elly. She tries
    her best to keep Elly's back free of all the curious youkai (and players)
    entering from the tunnel. But she got sick of her guard job a long time ago.

    They really like each other … somehow.



  ○ Stage 5 Boss
    Nagae Iku

    She slipped through the guard right after the player. Who knows what she is
    after. But there are two things she hates:

    Being interrupted, when she is in a hurry and always being suspected for
    everything.

    That happening both at the same time, she is quite unamused. But that makes
    her seem even more suspicious, doesn't it?



  ○ Stage 6 Boss
    Elly

    She quit her office guarding that mansion in Lotus Land Story and obtained a
    new power from the outside world: the power to manipulate Relations
    (i.e. she can do fancy maths). Thus she was able to trick Gensokyo's
    border*. Creating herself a place to research using her new powers.

    What would she want to research on that high tower? The Theory of Everything
    of course.

    Maybe she didn't even plan to use it to anyones harm. She certainly didn't
    know that the location she chose for here tower would cause that much
    trouble. But that's what scientists are like, only concentrating on what's
    important.

    Her spellcards are based on physical phenomena. Turning her experiments into
    weapons.

    fun fact: Taisei actually uses complex math for projectile positioning.


    * It's not like the border is a real limitation for youkai. Lots of youkai
      are powerful enough to pass through there without a problem. Some even
      visit the outside world regularily to hunt humans for food.
      But Elly broke it at some place and made it lead to her own place
      *somewhere inbetween*, which is unusual and shouldn't be easily possible.
